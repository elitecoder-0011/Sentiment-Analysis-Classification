# Sentiment Analysis Classification

This project contains two Jupyter notebooks showcasing implementations of popular deep learning architectures:


1. **RNN.ipynb**
   This notebook implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Sentiment Analysis Classification.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Data preprocessing for sequence-based inputs.
     - Definition and compilation of an RNN architecture.
     - Training the RNN on the given dataset.
     - Evaluation of model performance and visualization of results.

2. **Transformer.ipynb**
   This notebook implements a Transformer architecture for Sentiment Analysis Classification.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Implementation of the scaled dot-product attention mechanism.
     - Construction of the Transformer model with encoder and decoder components.
     - Training the model using advanced optimization techniques.
     - Evaluation of the model and analysis of its performance.
